This year, I have made contributions to both the RDS tool for SerDes debugging and the ML-DSP project. In the RDS tool, I developed features that automate tasks like RC file generation, APB signal debugging, and handshake/datapath timing information extraction, and I also add the user-friendly GUI feature for the RDS. The tool drastically reduces manual debugging time and improves accuracy, making it a valuable resource for engineers. In the ML-DSP project, I worked on improving BER by investigating, implementing and fine-tuning ML models for sequence equalization. I also optimized the input data generation process, developed more efficient preprocessing methods, and documented the investigation procedure and details.

Contributions to team success included running ML-DSP meetings, ensuring clear communication by documenting meeting minutes, and developing tools to enhance work efficiency. I also provided help on coding and machine learning problems, enabling teammates to solve issues more efficiently. To support the ML-DSP project, I reviewed many papers for insights, and develop codes for data preprocessing and model improvement. For RDS, I develop the code with several useful features added, providing critical debugging information. Additionally, I help intern onboarding to the RDS project, explaining the codebase, project structure, and conducting code reviews to maintain high code quality. 

In the next quarter, I will focus on enhancing the RDS tool by developing more comprehensive features to provide accurate, easy-to-check debugging information for SerDes engineers. The aim is to make it a highly efficient tool, reducing debugging time while improving accuracy. Additionally, I will refine the codebase to make it clearer and more accessible for other engineers to contribute.

I will continue my work on the ML-DSP project, experimenting with transformer models and abstracting new features from input data. The goal is to find a balance between improving BER and reducing model complexity to simplify hardware implementation.

Lastly, I will contribute to the JITRAP project by writing and running test cases, identifying bugs, and refining the tool to enhance its performance and usability.
