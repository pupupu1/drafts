This year, I have made contributions to both the RDS tool for SerDes debugging and the ML-DSP project. In the RDS tool, I developed features that automate tasks like RC file generation, APB signal debugging, and handshake/datapath timing information extraction, and I also add the user-friendly GUI feature for the RDS. The tool drastically reduces manual debugging time and improves accuracy, making it a valuable resource for engineers. In the ML-DSP project, I worked on improving BER by investigating, implementing and fine-tuning ML models for sequence equalization. I also optimized the input data generation process, developed more efficient preprocessing methods, and documented the investigation procedure and details.

Contributions to team success included running ML-DSP meetings, ensuring clear communication by documenting meeting minutes, and developing tools to enhance work efficiency. I also provided help on coding and machine learning problems, enabling teammates to solve issues more efficiently. To support the ML-DSP project, I reviewed many papers for insights, and develop codes for data preprocessing and model improvement. For RDS, I develop the code with several useful features added, providing critical debugging information. Additionally, I help intern onboarding to the RDS project, explaining the codebase, project structure, and conducting code reviews to maintain high code quality. 

In the next quarter, I will focus on enhancing the RDS tool by developing more comprehensive features to provide accurate, easy-to-check debugging information for SerDes engineers. The aim is to make it a highly efficient tool, reducing debugging time while improving accuracy. Additionally, I will refine the codebase to make it clearer and more accessible for other engineers to contribute.

I will continue my work on the ML-DSP project, experimenting with transformer models and abstracting new features from input data. The goal is to find a balance between improving BER and reducing model complexity to simplify hardware implementation.

Lastly, I will contribute to the JITRAP project by writing and running test cases, identifying bugs, and refining the tool to enhance its performance and usability.

######Intro#######
The Rapid Debug Simulation (RDS) tool is an ultra-fast simulation coverage and debugging solution designed specifically for digital simulations in SerDes PHY products. Built from extensive SerDes PHY customer support cases, RDS automates complex protocol timing parameter calculations and provides insightful diagnostic data without requiring manual intervention. Currently supporting the Ethernet 224G and USB4 protocols, RDS empowers engineers to quickly pinpoint and resolve issues, saving critical time in simulation analysis. With a flexible framework, RDS is designed for future expansion to support additional SerDes PHY protocols, making it a powerful tool for evolving simulation needs.

Enhanced Accuracy: By automating calculations, RDS minimizes human errors, ensuring consistent and precise results that are essential for reliable protocol timing validation.

Comprehensive Debug Insights: RDS provides detailed insights into specific failure points and timing issues, offering an overview that would typically require extensive, specialized knowledge to uncover manually.

Standardized Workflow: Unlike human debugging, which can vary in approach and accuracy, RDS follows a standardized, repeatable workflow, ensuring consistent analysis across different teams and projects.

Scalability and Extensibility: RDS’s framework is easily extensible, allowing it to adapt to new protocols and future requirements. This adaptability makes it a long-term asset for managing increasingly sophisticated protocols beyond current capabilities.

#####Supported Features#########
RDS provides a comprehensive suite of automated features tailored for USB4 and Ethernet 224G protocol debugging. Each feature addresses critical areas of digital simulation, enabling faster, more reliable analysis and pinpointing of issues. Below is a breakdown of supported features and their practical applications.

1. Automated RC File Generation
Description: Automatically generates RC files required for simulation setup, minimizing the manual configuration process.
Possible Failure Symptoms: Incorrectly configured RC files can lead to simulation setup errors, misaligned timing, and incorrect protocol behavior.
Use Case: RDS helps ensure RC files are consistently generated and free from human error, improving the accuracy of simulation setups.
2. APB Signal Debug
Description: Provides comprehensive debugging support for APB (Advanced Peripheral Bus) signals, essential for verifying data transfer and communication paths.
Possible Failure Symptoms: Issues such as signal misalignment, incorrect data handshakes, or bus errors can arise if APB signals are improperly debugged.
Customer Case: In a recent USB4 PHY simulation, APB signal misalignment caused data transfer failures. RDS was able to quickly identify the timing discrepancy, leading to a faster resolution.
3. Specific Signal Debug
Description: Allows users to debug a specific signal by entering its name in the command line, providing detailed information on the signal’s behavior.
Possible Failure Symptoms: Misconfigured or unstable signals may lead to data corruption, signal loss, or unexpected simulation outcomes.
Use Case: Engineers often use this feature to isolate and investigate individual signal behaviors, improving the granularity of the debug process.
4. Handshake Information Analysis
Description: Captures assert and deassert times for acknowledgment (ack) and request (req) signals across 4 lanes, and pstate tracking. For USB4, it also includes PMA (Physical Media Attachment) handshake details.
Possible Failure Symptoms: Incorrect handshake timings can cause synchronization issues, data stalling, or protocol failures.
Customer Case: In Ethernet 224G PHY cases, engineers faced data stalling due to a delayed ack signal. RDS identified the exact delay, enabling engineers to adjust timing parameters for seamless data flow.
5. Datapath (TX/RX) Analysis – Data Rate, UI Calculation, and Latency Calculation
Description: Provides TX/RX data rate tracking, unit interval (UI) calculation, and latency measurement. Currently, latency calculations are supported for USB4 only.
Possible Failure Symptoms: Incorrect data rates or UI misalignment can lead to data loss, jitter issues, and communication breakdowns.
